To use the iPhone RenderWater script:
1. Attach iPhoneWater script to water plane.
2. Make sure your main camera is tagged as MainCamera.
3. Hit Play and you should see reflections now!

NOTE: Your water surface must be flat. For best results, you may want to leave a hole
in your mesh and position a Plane primitive to that location instead. Your plane 
texture must be alpha blended for this to work. You are allowed to have more than 
one pool of water, however, those pools must be on the same virtual plane (they
must be level with each other).
